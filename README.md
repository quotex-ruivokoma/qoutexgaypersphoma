## What is the OTC Market?

The OTC (Over-the-Counter) market is a decentralized marketplace where
financial instruments are traded directly between two parties, without
the involvement of a central exchange. OTC markets are typically less
regulated than exchange-traded markets, and they offer greater
flexibility in terms of trading hours and contract sizes.

## Why Trade OTC Markets with Quotex?

There are several benefits to trading OTC markets with Quotex:

-   **Greater flexibility:** OTC markets offer greater flexibility in
    terms of trading hours and contract sizes, which can be beneficial
    for traders who want to trade outside of regular market hours or who
    want to trade larger or smaller positions.
-   **More trading opportunities:** OTC markets offer a wider range of
    trading opportunities than exchange-traded markets, including the
    ability to trade exotic assets and to trade on weekends.

    exchange-traded markets, which can save traders money on trading
    costs.
